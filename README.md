# MY-NEXT-APP
Built using React-three libraries and Next.js, this game features a 3-wheeled vehicle that moves based on cursor direction. Random falling shapes with physics properties create the challenge, and players must avoid them to survive. Score is stored in Supabase, and Tailwind CSS ensures mobile responsiveness. Deployed on Vercel.
